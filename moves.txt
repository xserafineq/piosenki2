Olly Murs
Big Snoop Dogg
You know we 'bout to make moves, ya dig?
Dance to the rhythm of the D.O. dub, G and a thug
Watch how I be in the club
Lookin', starin', darin', comparin'
In my book, they say sharin' is carin'
So give me a taste (haha)
And make your hips just dip to the bass
And watch me run the line
See what I come to find?

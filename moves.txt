I walk in the club like a million bucks
First I hit the bar for a couple of shots
We got the beautiful women, I think I'm makin' 'em blush
Then I spill my drink tryna cover it up
Got those dad dance moves, they ain't ready for 'em
Got the bad man groove, go steady on them
Hey se√±orita in her beautiful dress
Do you wanna dance? She's tellin' me "yes"
Slow down!
DJ, play that track

Check out my kung-fu kicks, like I'm under attack
I wave my arms like this from front to back
Bet you never seen a bad mother dance like that
Then you're backing me in with a kiss on the lips
Jump into the middle, come and wiggle your hips
My love, take my hand, I'll give you a spin
Step once, step twice, let the party begin
